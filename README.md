## 🚀 Projects

### 1. Quantitative Finance & Risk Analysis Algorithms
**Description:** Implementation of stochastic calculus models for asset pricing and risk management. This project demonstrates the application of physics-based mathematical concepts to financial markets.
* **Value at Risk (VaR) Engine:** Estimates VaR using **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)** and **Merton Jump-Diffusion** models to simulate asset paths and analyze tail risk.
* **Options Pricing Models:** Python implementations of **Black-Scholes** analytical formulas and **Monte Carlo simulations** for pricing European call options.
* **Time Series Analysis:** Statistical analysis of financial data (AAPL) to extract volatility parameters and drift.
* **Technologies:** Python, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Pandas.
* **Key Concepts:** Stochastic Processes, Monte Carlo Simulation, Financial Modeling.

### 2. Computational Geometry Toolkit
**Description:** A Python-based Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) toolkit designed to handle 2D geometric operations.
* **Features:** Custom `Point` class implementation with quadrant identification, distance calculations, and coordinate management.
* **Technologies:** Python (OOP).

### 3. Predicting Health Insurance Costs
**Description:** A linear regression model to predict health insurance costs based on patient characteristics.
* **Technologies:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn.
* **Original Dataset:** Kaggle.
