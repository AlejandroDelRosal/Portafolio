# Manuel Alejandro Del Rosal – Portfolio

> Physicist & M.S. Candidate in Applied Mathematics & CS. Focused on Astrophysics, Scientific Computation, and Data Science. 🔭 💻

Welcome! This portfolio showcases my transition from academic research in Physics to Data Science and Quantitative Finance, highlighting my ability to apply advanced mathematical models to real-world problems.

## 🚀 Projects

### 1. Quantitative Finance & Risk Analysis Algorithms
**Description:** Implementation of stochastic calculus models for asset pricing and risk management. This project demonstrates the application of physics-based mathematical concepts to financial markets.
* **Value at Risk (VaR) Engine:** Estimates VaR using Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) and Merton Jump-Diffusion models to simulate asset paths and analyze tail risk.
* **Options Pricing Models:** Python implementations of Black-Scholes analytical formulas and Monte Carlo simulations for pricing European call options.
* **Time Series Analysis:** Statistical analysis of financial data (AAPL) to extract volatility parameters and drift.
* **Technologies:** Python, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Pandas.
* **Key Concepts:** Stochastic Processes, Monte Carlo Simulation, Financial Modeling.

### 2. Real-Time Stock Portfolio Manager
**Description:** A robust Object-Oriented application designed to track, value, and manage a personal investment portfolio in real-time. This project bridges software engineering principles with financial accounting logic.
* **Dynamic Valuation:** Integrates the `yfinance` API to fetch live market data and perform mark-to-market valuation of assets instantly.
* **Algorithmic Accounting:** Implements a **Weighted Average Cost Basis** algorithm to accurately calculate realized PnL (Profit and Loss) and update inventory upon partial sales.
* **Persistence System:** Custom JSON serialization/deserialization engine to ensure data persistence (cash balance + asset inventory) across sessions.
* **Visualization:** Automated portfolio distribution charting using Matplotlib.
* **Technologies:** Python (Advanced OOP), yfinance API, Matplotlib, JSON.

### 3. Computational Geometry Toolkit
**Description:** A Python-based Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) toolkit designed to handle 2D geometric operations.
* **Features:** Custom Point class implementation with quadrant identification, distance calculations, and coordinate management.
* **Technologies:** Python (OOP).

### 4. Predicting Health Insurance Costs
**Description:** A linear regression model to predict health insurance costs based on patient characteristics.
* **Technologies:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn.
* **Original Dataset:** Kaggle.

### 5. Algorithmic String Processing & Palindrome Library
**Description:** A modular Python package designed for computational linguistics and symmetry analysis. This project emphasizes high-quality software engineering practices, including Unicode normalization and efficient algorithmic logic.

* **Symmetry Analysis Engine:** Implements an $O(n)$ frequency-counting algorithm to determine if a string's character set can form a palindrome, regardless of its original order.
* **Generative Reconstruction:** Algorithmic logic to rebuild symmetric strings by strategically distributing character parity across a left-center-right symmetry axis.
* **Robust Normalization Pipeline:** Integrated a text-cleaning utility using Unicode normalization (NFKD) and Regular Expressions to handle diacritics, special characters, and linguistic noise.
* **Modular Architecture:** Designed with professional package standards (modular structure, `__init__.py` exposition, and Google-style Docstrings) for high maintainability and clarity.

**Technologies:** Python, Collections (Counter), Unicodedata, Regex (re).
**Key Concepts:** Algorithm Design, Text Normalization, Software Modularization.
